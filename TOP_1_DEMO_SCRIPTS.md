## 💡 Pro Tips for a "Perfect 10" Recording

1.  **The "Magic" Moment**: The most impressive part is when you fill the form in Task 1 and then **immediately** show it appearing in Task 2. This proves the integration.
2.  **Focus on Value**: Don't just say "I used an LLM." Say "We use the Groq LPU to generate roadmaps 10x faster than traditional counselors."
3.  **Clean Setup**: 
    - Close all unrelated browser tabs.
    - Use a high-quality mic if possible.
    - Keep each video between **90 to 120 seconds**.
4.  **Be Energetic**: Your passion for the project makes a huge difference to the judges.
