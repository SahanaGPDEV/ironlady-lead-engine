## 👑 Top 5 Checklist for a "Legendary" Recording:
1.  **Cursor Movement**: Move your mouse slowly. Don't "wiggle" it too much.
2.  **Audio Quality**: Record in a quiet room. The speech-to-text transcription is already impressive—your voice should be too!
3.  **The "Wow" Factor**: When you click "Hear User Goal", let it play for 2 seconds. It's a huge technical flex.
4.  **No Typos**: Make sure your input data (Name/Goal) looks professional.
5.  **Be Proud!**: You've built a world-class system. Your confidence in the video will convince the judges!
